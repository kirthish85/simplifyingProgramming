Ques.Title:A share market bazaar where the value of stocks keep going up and down.
Code:c source code which takes company's name and its share value as inputs and updates the entry in csv file.
asn2_4.c and trying.c
Execution:user should enter company name and its share value.If entered company name matches with the name in the csv file
then it must update the share value of respective company.If the entered company name is not present in the csv file then
it will append the company name and its share value (asn2_4.c).
(trying.c)It is checking each line in the csv file.But the program is running in infinite loop,we are not able to stop the loop forever.
Tried all possible combinations but din't workout.. So we have attatched two c files.
